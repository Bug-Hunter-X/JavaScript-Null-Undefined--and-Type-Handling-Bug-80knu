# JavaScript Null,Undefined and Type Handling
This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript related to handling null, undefined values, and unexpected input types. It also shows a solution for robust error handling.

## Description
The `foo` function in `bug.js` initially lacked proper handling for null, undefined, or non-numeric inputs. This could lead to unexpected behavior or runtime errors. The improved version in `bugSolution.js` addresses these issues by explicitly checking input types and throwing informative error messages.

## How to run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the code using Node.js or a similar JavaScript environment.
